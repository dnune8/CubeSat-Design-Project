# CubeSat Design Project – Summer 2025
---
A self-guided project to design, simulate, and prototype a 1U CubeSat structure. This includes CAD modeling, structural analysis, basic thermal considerations, and 3D printing.
---
## Project Scope

- Design a 1U (10×10×10 cm) CubeSat frame in Fusion 360/NX  
- Perform structural analysis (FEA) to simulate launch conditions  
- Explore thermal design strategies for space applications  
- Visualize data using Python or MATLAB  
- Prototype the design with a 3D printer (Ender 3 Pro)  
- Document the process for portfolio and internship use  

---
## Tools
